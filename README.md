# data-sourcing-challenge

This challenge consisted of using a starter file, and then accessing the *New York Times* and *The Movie Database* using their API's and doing a search.  Once the results are return, the two separate lists are merged together, cleaned, and exported to a csv file.

The start file can be found [here](https://github.com/mikeyms1/data-sourcing-challenge/blob/main/retrieve_movie_data_starter_file.ipynb).  The code used for this assignment can be found in [retrieve_movie_data.ipynb](https://github.com/mikeyms1/data-sourcing-challenge/blob/main/retrieve_movie_data.ipynb).  The cleaned data is in a csv file and can be found in the [output](https://github.com/mikeyms1/data-sourcing-challenge/tree/main/output) folder and is called [cleaned_data.csv](https://github.com/mikeyms1/data-sourcing-challenge/blob/main/output/cleaned_data.csv).
